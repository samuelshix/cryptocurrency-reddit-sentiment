ASIC resistance shouldn\\'t be the only redeemable quality of a coin or the only reason it is getting pumped. \\n\\nWhy? ASIC resistance as of right now only means that a coin can\\'t be succesfully mined with the ASICs used for computationally bounded hashing algorithms like bitcoins SHA-256. \"ASIC resistant\" use memory bounded hashing algorithms. These algorithms are constrained by the memory bandwith of the hardware instead of its computational speed. \\n\\nWhat is stopping bitmain from developing ASICs for these memory bound algorithms? I would argue that it isn\\'t the memory hardness per se. GPU\\'s are not specialized in memory retrieval problems, so there\\'s definitely room for improvement through specialization. ASIC resistance will always be a temporary thing. Look at Litecoin. And if a coin wants to keep the democratic decentralization advantage of GPU-mining forever it should opt for PoS.',\n",

This means any of the (currently 67) cryptocurrencies supported by shapeshift can be transferred to a particl client and automatically converted to the native PART token for transacting on the Particl network.\\n\\nFurthermore the modular smart contract nature means other widgets and modules can be built to integrate other exchanges (both centralised and decentralised) and services into the Particl network and client e.g changelly integration for USDT:PART integration or widgets that connect direct fiat gateways.\\n\\nParticl also utilises atomic swaps so any other chain which utilizes atomic swaps can directly interact with the Particl network to exchange/swap PART (foregoing exchanges altogether). Current candidates include LTC, DCR and BTC.\\n\\nTo this end its a misconception to think Particle only supports the PART token. It actually supports multiple cryptocurrencies via a mechanic that brings value to the PART token whilst providing a means to buy and sell goods anonymously using those cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n...\\n\\n**There are advantages to this approach:**\\n\\n- For one it means Particl can simplify its user interface by driving all core transactions on the Particl network via the PART token.\\n\\n- It makes the **Particl platform both a fiat/liquidity magnet as it provides non-speculative value to multiple cryptocurrencies** which are sent to it and acts as a liquidity generator since it creates the means for people to buy/sell goods with multiple cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nAs the Particl network grows **this would strengthen the links between cryptocurrency and fiat whilst simultaneously making cryptocurrency more independent of fiat.**\\n\\n- This approach creates economic incentives to hold and promote the token and benefits holders as its value increases in a manner proportional to increasing non-speculative use on the Particl network.\\n\\n- Contrast this with systems like syscoin where the native sys token is not essential to transact. It suffers from diminished speculator and thus network effects to propagate spread, promotion and usage of the native token and even if non-speculative use of the syscoin network increases this does necessarily translate to increased buy demand  on the sys token.\\n\\n- The PART token is used to secure the Particl  network via PoS. Increased non speculative use of the PART token to transact leads to diversification of PART.\\n\\nThose who set their clients to stake to earn a portion of the marketplace/transaction fees + staking rewards thus wind up increasing the node count and diversification which increases the security of the network.\\n\\n- The PART token has a dual nature: A public token for where the added cost/verification time of transacting privately is not necessary and where accountability is a requirement (e.g. selling large volume, low cost, high frequency white-hat goods).\\n\\nA large transaction pool is required to make the private ringCT transactions work. If multiple currencies were allowed to buy/sell goods directly (rather than be first converted to the native PART token), the pool of available transactions for RingCT would be diluted and thus the anonymity ringCT provides would be weakened.\\n\\n...\\n\\nParticl will provide a system where all the economic, network and pragmatic incentives of cryptocurrency are in perfect alignment, something which is not true of many other systems in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.\\n\\nPerhaps the most important thing I haven't stated is that by integrating all the services it does and allowing for modular expansion under one privacy centric platform, **Particl provides convenience and streamlines existing processes for private, anonymous and public commerce independent of traditional fiat.**\\n\\n...\\n\\n**In summary cryptocurrencies that choose to integrate with the Particl platform will instantly find non-speculative uses and revenue. This will drive fiat into those cryptocurrencies, increasing both their liquidity and value as these will now be used to buy and sell goods on the Particl platform via its decentralised marketplace and any other services it offers.**\",\n",

The client nodes have the capacity for sending encrypted messages between each other allowing for truly private communications between individuals on the Particl network.\\n\\n- Settlement security by providing a trustless third party free escrow service (the mutually assured destruction escrow) whereby both seller and buyer deposit a bond that can only be released when both sides agree goods/services have been delivered as specified.\\n\\n...\\n\\nWhilst Monero and other private currencies offer anonymous transaction security with the benefits of decentralisation, they do not provide the other forms of decentralised security I've just listed *which Particl and currently Particl alone proposes to*.\\n\\nYes decentralised marketplaces could accept monero *currency* but they would have to provide decentralised, trustless privacy centric escrow, communications and private listings to provide the same level of service and flexibility of selling/buying options that the Particl *platform* provides.\\n\\nThis is because in addition to what I've described Particl also enables anonymous or public settlement of public listings.\\n\\n...\\n\\nThe biggest single threat to ecommerce is censorship either by the platform provider or by take down of the platform provider. We have seen multiple platforms that use XMR disappear and we have many documented instances of legitimate, legal commerce being censored by the platform provider for reasons that are often questionable at best. \\n\\n**The Particl network provides a resilient platform to protect against censorship.**\\n\\n...\\n\\nPerhaps the most important thing I haven't stated is that by integrating all the services it does and allowing for modular expansion under one privacy centric platform, **Particl provides convenience and streamlines existing processes for private, anonymous and public commerce independent of traditional fiat.**\\n\\n...\\n\\n**NB: I am bullish on XMR.** It had an incredible network effect going which has not been realised yet. I'd rather the XMR team understood the ethos behind Particl and looked for opportunities to collaborate in this instance as an XMR:PART integration would represent the ultimate in private tx for me.\\n\\n**Addendum:** Before you vote on this, carefully consider the merit of what I'm saying and imagine what it would be like if such a system were to hypothetically exist regardless of who developed it. I'm aware of SAFEX and syscoin but if you know of any other platforms like Particl I am keen to hear about them.\",\n",

Using only the native PART token simplifies this mechanic.\\n\\nIt is for these reasons and the simple economics of incentivisation that all currencies fed into particl will be converted to native PART token via integrated shapeshift function prior to use on the particl network.\\n\\nParticl is a modular framework and yes smart contracts mechanisms are involved on the bitcoin core codebase it uses. Their use of ringCT and focus on truly trustless privacy and anonymity is partly why they avoided ETH but also wish to sidestep any possible scalability issues present in ETH currently or bloat issues of launching a highly focused but intensive product. I'm sure there's a bit of ego to prove their coding chops too.\\n\\n**The first major module they plan to launch in Q1 2018 is the decentralised marketplace and communications platform**.\\n\\nThis marketplace will allow for:\\n\\n- Public and private listings of goods for sale (private listings only viewable if the key is known), \\n\\n- RingCT to facilitate truly private transactions but also a public token to facilitate non-anonymous one's.\\n\\n- Encrypted end to end messaging including group messaging.\\n\\n- Filters and categorisation systems to help find goods.\\n\\n- Automated shapeshift integration to automatically convert multiple the 67 and growing cryptocurrencies currently supported by shapeshift into PART for transacting on the Particl network.\\n\\n- Modularity allowing for widgets and other tools to be built in and plugged into the particl network providing an interface to link other decentralized exchanges and tools to the main marketplace as well as the particl ecosystem.\\n\\n- Atomic swaps (like LTC and DCR) to allow frictionless transfers and conversions of tokens.\\n\\nOn minimum viable product release (Q1 2018) the marketplace should be essentially complete in the sense of publicly usable minus the reputation systems they plan to implement after.\\n\\nFurther reading:\\n\\n/r/Particl/comments/732wmu/the_importance_of_decentralized_marketplaces_in/\\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU&time_continue=55\\n\\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/news/how-cryptocurrency-agnosticism-could-impact-industry/?utm_campaign=rss_headlines&utm_source=rss_www&utm_medium=referral\\n\\nhttps://particl.wiki/articles-about-particl\\n\\nI believe Particl if realised as designed will impact ecommerce massively on a paradigm shifting level.

The project will not use it's funds to needlessly hype and will likely deliver the marketplace minimum viable product in Q1 2018 to justify it and silence all critics. \\n\\nThis is because the team (which is now greatly expanded and actually funded) have been heavily criticised for not delivering in the past (as the much smaller, unfunded SDC prior to setting up their foundation) in spite of the history showing clear development (actually rapid for a project of this nature) and currently meeting all milestones given.\\n\\nFrom a speculative point of view there are numerous reasons to preferentially invest in Particl:\\n\\n- Holding tokens confers true stakeholder ownership of the network, \\n\\n- Receipt of transaction fees proportional to stake and number of transactions on the network. \\n\\n- Receipt of interest but with decreasing annual inflation rate (5% PA year one to flat 2% year 4 onwards) to facilitate early adoption. \\n\\n- Limited token supply with significant lockup due to PoS. When marketplace is launched if used, the buy demand on PART will be massive relative to circulating supply even for small scale use of the marketplace which should drive up the price of PART massively.\\n\\nIf Particl is successful then I believe it will be a literal juggernaut in the making as far as use cases, speculative returns and technology advances in crypto go.\\n\\n...\\n\\nThere are those that doubt such a technology will be delivered, I am **not** advising you to buy but I am advising you to watch. Delivery of this product could be very interesting indeed.\",\n",

I really believe in Sergey Nazarov and I’ve watched so many interviews of him and I think he is a genuine guy. \\n\\nThen yesterday I was just monitoring the price movements of LINK while lying on my bed and trying to recover from bad flu. And I came across this tweet from fake Sergey Nazarov twitter account and I just believed it must be true and that was my gut feeling or may be I’m very sick. And when I check the price of the LINK token and it was little bit down and I was like it must be because of this AIRDROP. \\n\\nThen I just reacted and only thing in my mind was getting hold of some free LINK tokens from the AIRDROP.\\n￼\\n\\nWithdraw my 12,216 LINK Tokens from  Binance Exchange Ether address\\nhttps://ethplorer.io/address/0x3f5ce5fbfe3e9af3971dd833d26ba9b5c936f0be\\n\\nI created this MyEtherwallet address with intention of getting my free AIRDROP LINK tokens according the twitter scam which linked to this website http://linksmartcontract.com/blog/\\n\\nthen I transferred my 12K LINK tokens and 0.2 ETHER into below MyEtherwallet address from my BInance exchange account \\n\\nhttps://ethplorer.io/address/0x53737a5963f464201f5f55f650061d64a094a03b\\n\\nup until now everything was fine Its my ether address and I was holding the private key.

It seems makers do not publish their price. So if there are 10000 makers indexed, the taker has to ask all the 10000 about their price.\\nFor example, taker wants to buy 10 X for 20 Y. Now it has to ask all the makers and find the ones that sell 1 X at 2 Y. That makes it quite inefficient, isn't it?\\n\\n2. Who can be indexer and who can be oracle? Can any node be an indexer? If yes, what's the synchronization protocol.\\n\\n3. The expiration on the order will make things quite slow. The taker fills the order, and waits and possibly the maker can cancel the order. Not only you have to wait for the ethereum transaction to be consolidated, but even the expiration time. How is that going to work?\\n\\n4. Am I right or it cannot be used to exchange currency of other blockchains? Because to me, exchanging only tokens in ethereum doesn't seem extremely useful. If instead there was an exchange protocol for other currencies, using ethereum as contract platform and ether used for fees, that would THE trading platform. Instead, this is just an ethereum token trading platform, meh.\\n\",\n",

I started off with 0.01 BTC and after a couple of trades 24 hours went by and now I have 0.02 BTC ( after fees ). I now want to convert my BTC back to euros.\\nBut the BTC is less worth at this time than at the time I made my conversion from EUR to BTC since this coin itsself is a cryptocurrency. Now all that trading that I have been doing essentially evaporated because its less worth. Does this mean I have to always check the BTC/EUR rate before converting or do I not need to worry about this since BTC is pretty stable?\\n\\n3) Last one, what do you guys use to convert your EUR to BTC easily. Any fees?\\n\\nI really want to learn more about cryptocurrency so I appreciate your time. Thank you guys in advance!!',\n",

In reality there is no ceiling for investment as even people who don't have any money can speculate and buy on credit hoping the increase in value will cover any interest on the credit card and provide gains as well.

To lock in profits set a stop loss at .013 or some other arbitrary number so if it goes up then drops a bunch you still gain profits. All coins go up then down even if they have a promising future.

VTC had 3 major things that got people's attention. First was Bitcoin Gold being an obvious scam and being similar to VTC. That put the spotlight on VTC which was already a solid coin just without much marketing. The second was after this attention was brought to the coin and it started to slowly rise, Ledger support was added, this was when the coin really started to get some legs and take off. Then the one click miner was released, and it pumped again because that's a big deal. Prior to these 3 things people didn't particularly care about the coin.\\n\\nGRS...what news has it had? What has it done recently? What is in the pipeline? These things are all up in the air. Between an obvious pump and dump effort, and people who missed the VTC train, it blew up...but watch what happens. The dump is going to happen, and the price will plummet, and it will be clear it's a dump. How faithful are the GRS holders then? I suspect the panic sells are going to be off the chart. They will start mass selling their coin too so they can reap some profits, which will lead to more panic, more selling, and then people simply cutting their losses.\\n\\nThat's the other thing about VTC...the community at large are hodlers, they have faith in the coin and have had faith for a *long* time.

Present valuations are determined solely by market speculators (mostly accumulators aware about the project potential).\\n\\nHowever on release of their decentralised marketplace module in Q1 2018, provided its released with full atomic swaps and shapeshift/exchange integration, it's buy side dynamics will change significantly.\\n\\nIt maybe first worth reading up on the project in more detail:\\n\\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/76ot7k/thoughts_about_particle/\\n\\nAt this stage I estimate a 5x to 20x (conservative is 5x) rise in price purely on a hype cycle alone. Longer term however I view it very differently to other assets due to it's liquidity characteristics which resemble DASH but with actual utility to self perpetuate it. \\n\\nThis is because:\\n\\n- People decide to use the Particl marketplace.\\n- People sent their crypto to the Particl client.\\n- This converts to PART: Buy pressure on PART.\\n- People buy PART in the Particl client to transact.\\n- People use PART escrow: PARTs get locked into escrow contract.\\n- Circulating supply of PART gets further restricted.\\n- Successful buying/selling of goods = repeat custom exclusively in PART token.\\n- Repeat custom = regular repeat buy pressure on PART per individual.\\n- Repeat custom = word of mouth = more new customers on Particl marketplace. This perpetuates first step.\\n- Buy pressure increases. More escrows. Further liquidity lockup.\\n\\n...\\n\\n- More dApps (beyond market place) release as PART hype & awareness increases = more buy pressure on PART.\\n\\n- Staking locks away PART also restricting circulating supply.\\n\\n- As value of PART increases incentive to stake increases (as stakers earn tx fees). As PART value increases and tx frequency increases, stakers earn more rewards perpetuating further staking.\\n\\n- More PART gets locked in staking. Lower circulating supply.\\n\\n- Rapidly escalating PART price.\\n\\nSo provided it is released as described and people use it as a marketplace non-speculatively, with time it's price should rise exponentially independent of traditional exchange dependent model.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI hope this makes it super clear why I rank Particl on par with Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of price growth potential.\\n\\n...\\n\\n**Full disclosure:** I am long Ethereum (ETH), Particl (PART), OmiseGo (OMG), Wetrust (TRST), Iconomi (ICN) and Augur (REP).\\n\\nAll trading decisions are your own please do your due dilligence and independent multi-sourced research.\",\n",

       "  'comments': [{'text': 'To address a lot of the worrying things I\\'m seeing in this thread from complete investing newbies...\\n\\n1. If you aren\\'t prepared for the price to go down, 40, 60, or even 100% then you should not be invested in cryptocurrencies, let alone risky small cap investments. If you want to play in this space you have to be absolutely sure that when you see this happen, you don\\'t panic, evaluate the situation as a whole, and remember what the goals of your trade were in the first place. This is partially why it\\'s so important to invest in stuff you believe in and understand...when the weather gets bad you want to make sure you can withstand the storm because you believe it will end eventually. And if you fancy yourself a day trader, then before you get into a trade make sure you have set goals and stop losses, otherwise your floundering with no plan.\\n\\n2. If you\\'re putting money in thinking it\\'s just always going to go up. Days like this are normal in all markets, and while it sucks to feel like you\\'re losing money the ultimate lesson an investor can learn is patience. Because it seems to me many of the people who post here have never invested in other markets and expect everything to go up 100% a week. Crypto moves faster than any market, and what seems like a disaster today could be completely forgotten in three. \\n\\n3. STOP TRADING TO FOMO. Everyone keeps asking if they should trade all their down alts to go for BTC...WHY? You\\'re trading in your assets at a discount to buy an asset at a premium. Just because you feel like you\\'re missing out, don\\'t chase it. Read this thread or any other to see countless stories of people selling to chase a new coin, only to have the coin they just sold rise 50% over the next day. In crypto, if you believe in the project, hold tight. The majority of active traders lose money.\\n\\n4. There are two types of people you can be here. For example, in a month when XLM crosses a dollar there is going to be one person saying \"thank god I bought that dip at 62\" and one person saying \"well got in at 1.01, hope this works out\". Which do you want to be?\\n\\n5. It\\'s a lot easier to hold something if you believe in it. So if you\\'re just here buying coins that you don\\'t understand with no real value, it\\'s going to be a lot harder when you see it go down to sit tight. \\n\\n6. You should always have some ETH and BTC in your portfolio. The fact that many of you view them as \"boring\" is extremely worrisome. A stock portfolio returning 30% in a year would be absolutely killing it, but you think that if bitcoin only goes up 100% it\\'s a total waste. If you want to be in the crypto market, make sure you hedge a bit. As BTC goes up, Alts tend to go down.\\n\\n7. Be careful of the excessive shilling that occurs here and on other forums. Many of the coins are shilled but for good reasons, but many more are people just trying to suckers other into buying because they are nervous they made a bad decision. With that being said, some of the coins you\\'ve been reading here a lot DO have a bright future, and can be considered \"Safer\" picks in such a crazy market, i.e. REQ VEN XMR NEO XLM. Do your research on this coins. Research the team, research the product, research the potential use cases and potential amount of users. If you believe it, buy it. \\n\\nAnyone just wanted to vent and hopefully help some people from making some bad choices. Just my 2cents.\\n\\n',\n",

I know some people can become very fanatic with their beliefs (religions and soccer are proof of this) but I can do nothing more than present them the facts and let them decide by themselves.\\n\\nIn my linked comment below you can see facts taken from the source code of the verge project where the team copy pasted the 3years old code from OpalCoin that contains the feature of Stealth Addresses AS IS, without even modifying it to the extend that even the error messages would display OpalCoin instead of Verge. You would think there is some testing before publishing on master branch.. Unless the developers are happy with their users seeing Opalcoin in their Verge software. What makes it even worse is that OpalCoin 4clause BSD license requires any party that uses their code to give them credit in advertisement material, something that never happened from the Verge team. This is in contrast with how the open source world works. See for your self here:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/vergecurrency/comments/7nu1ll/verge_marketing_making_big_changes_15_tweets_in_4/ds4xs53/\\n\\nAnother guy did a similar research and published his results on a github issue.

He only got attacked and the issue was marked as spam.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I\\'m not saying you are not allowed to \"reuse\" code from open source projects, the point is that everyone believes the Verge team is \"hard working\", they worked their asses off during new years eve to produce a release and people idolise them like gods while the truth is that the hard work has been done by the teams of the other coins who never received any credits and the Verge team is working hard to resolve bugs they themselves introduced by blindly copying the code, not even testing it and publishing it to the world.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/issues/304',\n",

Isn\\'t this apart of the research process? Asking a community of people who know more? I understand that it opens the flood gates for people to shill their own coin but at the same time, what\\'s bad about asking for some coins to research? There\\'s literally thousands of coins out there and as someone who is new to the game, why is it looked down upon to reach out to more knowledgable people? Isn\\'t that what the community is for? Learn from each other? If Joe Somebody asks what would be a good investment and 10 people respond with 10 different coins, now he\\'s gone from 3000+ coins to research down to 10. And if Joe doesn\\'t like those 10, then he can look for more but I just don\\'t understand why it\\'s so bad to reach out and ask people what they think is good? And who cares if shilling happens? I really don\\'t understand what\\'s so bad about that? I\\'ve read many a shill and enjoyed to read the positives of that project. I didn\\'t invest in most (although I wished I did on some of them) but hearing more than what the white paper offers was informational.\\n\\nAnother thing that irks me is when someone posts, \"This coin is going to take off but I\\'m not going to spoon feed you, DYOR.\" How about you tell us why YOU think it\\'s going to do well. Everyone processes this information differently so while someone will read a white paper and say, \"Oh wow, so much potential.\" Someone else might think that it\\'s nothing more than a niche coin that won\\'t take off. Maybe they don\\'t see the larger picture. Maybe they\\'re not understanding the full potential of a coin. Help them out.\\n\\nInstead of getting mad at people who are reaching out to a community literally just for cryptocurrency, why not share with them what you\\'ve learned because in the end, that\\'s how cryptos will succeed. It\\'s still black magic for the majority of the world which makes them weary about it all and until people explain what these thousands of different projects do and how they can help in a more simple way, people will continue to be weary about it all.

Because new economy stocks and houses were bought with secured loans. Loans secured with the very same asset! Banks gave you money if you used your stocks or your house(s) as a security. With that money people bought even more stocks or houses. The problem with that is the following: If the price drops for some reason, the value of your security drops and the banks will force the debtors to sell their stocks or houses. When people sell their assets it will push the prices even further down - resulting again in a lower value of securities. A downward spiral - that‘s the real popping of the bubble!\\n\\nNow think about cryptos - right now, no bank on the planet will accept cryptos as security. So if the price of cryptos drop, noone is forced to sell their coins. The current price peak is not backed by loans based on cryptos as a security! That‘s why cryptos can easily recover from price dips like yesterday!',\n",

I have been watching it forever, but never had the juevos to dive in. I bought my first $100 in BTC in September. When that turned into $200, I got in with $2000 more BTC, $400 ETH, and $100 LTC. Now I want to really get going.\\n\\n\\n\\nI fully understand the extreme risk behind investing in crypto right now. The money I am looking to invest is not required for living my normal life. I'm looking to spread $20,000 total (including that amount I'm already HODL'ing). If it turns into $0 next month, I'll be mad, but it won't ruin me.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat being said, I wanted help with ideas on where to put it all. My original idea was the following (feel free to offer a different spread if you'd like):\\n\\n\\n\\n$10000 BTC\\n\\n\\n\\n$2500 ETH\\n\\n\\n\\n$2500 LTC\\n\\n\\n\\n$1000 of 5 different Alt-Coins\\n\\n\\n\\nI want to set this all up this week, then HODL it until at least next December. If I come out on top, sweet. I'll use it to buy something nice/pay of my car/pay off my mortgage (moon-shot, not expecting this). If it all burns to rubble, then I'll move on to something else to invest in next year. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo if you are in love with a specific Alt-Coin, shill your heart out. If you have a specific trader/app/wallet you love, please let me know. \\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions? Ask them.\\n\\n\\n\\nBitconnect? Fuck them. \\n\\n\\n\\nSeriously, don't try to pass that ponzi scheme off as investing. Throwing in $50k and pocketing ~$500/day sounded great, until I dug deeper to see that beautiful pyramid scheme for what it is. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, I'm in the US, if that factors into your suggestion at all.\\n\\n\",\n",

No one really has the big picture and all the reasons you see for X going up or down is pure speculation, many times driven by hidden agendas. \\n\\nAnother advice: Never, and I mean never, invest money that you might need tomorrow, next week, next month, next trimester.

I made a couple emotional errors right off the bat but I recognized them. It clearly takes more patience than I was exercising.

This was my response:\\n\\nNo, because I realize that in the grand scheme of things that this 3 week slump will inevitably just be a blip on the radar.\\n\\nI will readily admit that it is a lot easier for me to say that as someone who has cashed out profits multiple times over; however, I also held through many crashes, going back to the first one experienced in 2011. It does get frustrating to see the price dropping, then jump a bit, stagnate, then drop again. \\n\\nBut, this sounds cliché, but if you are a believer in crypto, the technology behind it, and are throwing your support behind solid projects instead of shitcoins, then this ride will be easier.\\n\\n>In contrast, there's no significant community of people who conduct commerce exclusively (or even primarily) in Bitcoins. And you can't eat, live in, or make jewelry out of Bitcoins. And this means there's no logical stopping point to Bitcoin's price decline. So far Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buying Bitcoins as the price falls, convinced that the price will go back up eventually. But as the hoped-for rally has failed to materialize, more have gotten discouraged or bored and cash out, pushing the price down further. This process has been going on for a couple of months, and now it appears to be accelerating. I suspect it's terminal.\\n\\nThat is a quote from August of 2011, during a period where the price of Bitcoin dropped from an ATH of $32 to its then-price of $6.50. People have been writing off Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) and predicting it's demise since it was created. And it's still here, still flexing its muscles and it's here to stay. And weeks or months from now, people will look at this crash going on now and either laugh since they held through it, or cry that they didn't have the fortitude to hold and sold.\",\n",

Honestly, how often do we have to see this same pattern until you people finally realize that this is just the normal life cycle of every promising coin? A few people find it, invest, and start the shilling. Once enough people are convinced, the price starts to go up. Maybe there\\'s some good news or some positive tweet, and suddenly daytraders see their chance to jump on the train, and the price shoots up like crazy within days. Now all those kids go crazy and think they have found the new ETH and we see lambo memes and out-of-this-world price predictions for EOY with 100x or even more everywhere. \\n\\nHowever, once the market is saturated the day traders take their profits and move on to the next coin. The price dumps down to 70% of ATH. Now the FUD starts. Those who bought at ATH panic sell. Those who had missed the train in the first place enjoy to gloat over the others misfortunes and post their \"I told you so\" FUD everywhere. Consequently, the price goes down to 50% of ATH. Suddenly those who thought they have found the new ETH realize that they were wrong all along. They see the price dumping, they see all this FUD, and then sell their holdings to jump on the next coin which they think is the new ETH. And the funny thing is, all along NOTHING has changed about the coin at all. The idea, the code, the team, the collaborations and partners are all still exactly the same. Only the market price went up by 500% and then crashed down again almost to where it took off. Then, it typically takes some time to recover, but all the good coins come back eventually. And once they do, everybody that sold before jumps on the train again.\\n\\nSure, this pattern is so obvious you could just go ahead and daytrade. Get it on time and sell on time. If you\\'re good at this, you can make good money from this. Or you just ignore all the shilling and FUD, the 200% gains and the 80% losses, completely, you just do your research, invest, and hold. Just accept the fact that the current price is irrelevant as long as you don\\'t want to sell. Nobody wants to buy XRB right now and therefore the price goes down. Ok, that\\'s fine - do you want to sell or do you want to hold? If you want to hold, then the current price doesn\\'t matter. If you want to sell, ask yourself why you didn\\'t want to sell it a few weeks ago when the price was much higher than it is now. Why would you want to sell VEN for $7 when you didn\\'t want to sell it for $10? Why would you want to sell XRB for $12 if you didn\\'t want to sell it for $30 just a few weeks ago? \\n\\nSo decide, what do you want to do? If you want to hold long term, then choose projects you believe in and don\\'t panic once day traders sell and move on to the next pump. Or do you want to daytrade, always chasing the next pump? That\\'s fine as well, but then sell at highs and don\\'t wait until the shill is over and your coin gets dumped. Every coin, no matter how good it is, will get dumped after a big pump. That\\'s just what happens. Learn to live with it or learn how to daytrade. ',\n",

When it come to being technical, I\\'m the guy who refers you to my buddy lol.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ve been trying to dig more into the tech behind crypto and found a lot of things VERY confusing, but, all \"technoogy\" aside, I was curious as to what creating and launching a coin really ment.\\n\\nFact is, after 1 google search and 20 minutes, I trasfersd $100 to a ETH wallet and I created a coin (SERPcoin) with a 50 million supply with a few clicks and copy and paste. https://etherscan.io/…/0xd9e2cb90c1d3af1e1506199553d6e66afb…\\n\\nThe entire thing took less than an hour.\\n\\nToday I created a second coin as a joke (CondomCoin) with a 50 trillion supply and sent 25 trillion to someone else. https://etherscan.io/…/0xb861886107b754399b45a16332cc0cb183…\\n\\nNow I really want everyone to think about the fact that a person with no real technical understanding could create a coin in under an hour. I\\'m sure everyone in this group probably could too following the same tutorial: https://steemit.com/…/how-to-create-your-own-ethereum-token…\\n\\nMy primary business is in marketing so believe me when I say, for an extra $50 to put up a website and 10k on a copywriter, I could easily launch an ico and sell a shit ton off these useless tokens promising things that don\\'t even exist.\\n\\nIts actually pretty easy to get listed on exchanged and coin market cap if you create enough hype and trading volume around your coin as well. Just meet their criteria and apply.\\n\\nThis is what 90% of the stuff in crypto is, nothing more than a coin that took 20 minutes to make and $100. I want everyone new in this group to realize that 99% of the promises that cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have are in things that do not exist and tech that hasn\\'t even been developed yet.\\n\\nThis is why all this is so exciting but also so scary.\\n\\nBefore you invest in a coin do you ask who are the developers on a project? What funding do they have? Do they even have a working platform? If not, What\\'s the application they are working for and what are their benchmarks? Is the coin actually used to power the tech or is it just a \"coin\" that has no real function?\\n\\nThe reason why people spend hours really digging into these coins and the projects behind them is because it\\'s extremely important to understand the REAL risk.\\n\\nIf I can create a coin in 20 minutes, put up a website in an hour, and have a ico promising pipe dreams, ready to launch in a week, in a world with no rules or regulations...\\n\\nJust want to make sure everyone is safe.

Take this with a grain of salt because it’s only chatter at this point in time, but he said that the wealth management industry as a whole is starting to take Bitcoin more seriously.  Many of them were firmly against it, but more and more advisors have warmed up to the idea of allocating a small percentage of portfolios into crypto (3-10% max, usually 5% on average).  It’s not something they are trying to push, but many clients have been requesting to add it to their portfolios.  Most importantly, if and when institutional money pours in which it likely will eventually, it’s not going into alts up front.  It’s going into Bitcoin.

       "   {'text': 'In the midst of what gets posted on these threads, I  figure I would share my portfolio and a bunch of my personal thoughts. I won\\'t lie when I say it\\'s a lot different than what most people on this subreddit have in their portfolios:\\n\\n- **Monero**: 40%\\n\\n- **Coss**: 20%\\n\\n- **Siacoin**: 10%\\n\\n- **Aeon**: 9%\\n\\n- **Ethereum**: 8%\\n\\n- **Neo**: 5%\\n\\n- **Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash**: 5%\\n\\n- **Litecoin**: 3%\\n\\nMy two satoshis on why I bought what I bought:\\n\\n- As you can tell from my flair, Monero makes up the bulk of my portfolio. I bought it back in 2016 after it first pumped to several dollars from the now defunct AlphaBay accepting it for payment. It is by far the one coin I have the most faith and confidence in. Monero is what Bitcoin should have been from the very start. Its privacy, dynamic blocksize, egalitarian hashing algorithm, and tail emission all combined together address a lot of Bitcoin\\'s big weaknesses.\\n\\n- COSS is by far my riskiest asset. I have already made a huge amount of money from it since I scooped up a truckload of it when it was worth pennies. The fee splits provided by COSS are unbelievably generous, and from them you can almost build a sort of psuedo-index fund from fee splits. If COSS can get its exchange up and running, with a good engine to handle increased volume, and the fiat ramps working, this will be an epic moonshot and the passive income will set me up for life. Currently I\\'m using the fee splits to simply stack up on more COSS. I make enough from fee splits as it is to distribute COSS + convert to/distribute the ETH which is then reinvested into buying more COSS. Again though, COSS is a huge risk. Their last UI rollout did not go well, and they had a fatal bug that forced people into using market orders instead of limit orders for a short time. There is a definite non-zero chance they could mess up the introduction of fiat and/or not be able to handle an increased load of traffic, and that would not bode well at all. I have confidence in them being able to succeed though!\\n\\n- Siacoin is a personal favorite of mine. Decentralized cloud storage is going to become a big thing in the near future, and I really like the Sia team\\'s ambitious roadmap and their knowledge of software / crypto development.\\n\\n- Aeon is another small MCap/big gamble. For those not familiar with it, Aeon is like Monero\\'s little brother. It\\'s designed to be a lightweight version of Monero that can run on and be mined on mobile phones. Think of it like being Monero\\'s version of Litecoin. Currently, Aeon is coming right off the middle of a code rebase, which is really big news for such a small coin.\\n\\n- I would have more ETH in my portfolio... unfortunately for me, I was really turned off by ETH from the DAO hack and way it was handled. I didn\\'t buy as much ETH as I could have. Given how much ETH has gone up from 2017, that one hurt.\\n\\n- NEO is another good blue chip. I like being able to generate GAS from just having it sit in my wallet. If you want a good \"HODL\", NEO is awesome in that regard.\\n\\n- All portfolios should have at least some BTC. I don\\'t care how much you have; just make sure it isn\\'t very close to or at 0%. It is a grave mistake to be 100% all in alts. I have a lot of issues with BTC\\'s fees, slow tx times, and lack of privacy/fungibility. However, I cannot deny its enormous hashrate and first-mover advantage. You do not want to see BTC suffer. If BTC goes down, it takes everything else down with it.\\n\\n- Litecoin rounds out my portfolio as another blue chip. I expect LTC to thrive in the future even though it will be challenged by Nano, and its hashrate has exploded to over 140 TH/s. That is a very good sign for its price.\\n\\nSo there you have it. Most of this was done from simple DYOR, along with buying a lot of it back in 2016/early 2017 when prices were a lot lower than where they are now. I may start to get my feet wet with some other coins that are constantly repeated over and over again (you guys know what they are), but I\\'m wary of the fact that many people probably bought those coins at their ATHs and are just desperate for another pump so they can unload their bags and try to chase another coin.\\n\\nFor those of you looking for legitimate advice on how/what to invest in:\\n\\n- Do an intense amount of research on a coin before you buy. Do not buy something on just Reddit/Twitter/4chan hype. Read the whitepaper, and then read it again. Look at the Github activity and what is being done on development for the project. Be cautious about investing in anything that has no working product.\\n\\n- Do not buy at an ATH. Do not succumb to FOMO. If you absolutely must buy something *right now*, expect to be in the red for the short term.\\n\\n- Dollar-cost-average your purchases. \\n\\n- Don\\'t be afraid to take profits.\\n\\n- Do not try to time the market. Do not try to daytrade. And for god\\'s sake, don\\'t even think about margin trading. You\\'ll probably have better luck playing Russian Roulette than seeing your 50 BTC 40x long position get liquidated. There are very painful stories on large trading subreddits where people holding millions of dollars in crypto lost it all because they got greedy. If you MUST actively trade, set aside funds that you know you won\\'t touch. IMO I like to be more conservative in this environment. I will sell and profit take, but for the most I just buy and hold. You\\'ll sleep better at night if you do.\\n\\n- It\\'s kinda ok to look at Blockfolio or CMC all the time, even if it ultimately isn\\'t good for you. I admit, I look at it a lot. The problem comes when you panic at seeing your portfolio take a big hit like when we had the recent crash. If you\\'re sweating bullets in a bear market, you either A) invested more than you could afford to lose or B) bought coins you don\\'t really believe in.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping in the near future to be a bit more active in these daily threads because I know there are people out there who want to see more quality posts in these dailies.

       "   {'text': \"So I will try to provide my opinion on the state of the market currently and specifically discuss which strategies are winning strategies at the moment.  Now this is not to say that they will be winning moves a month from now or even couple of weeks from now, and again I state that these are my opinions. \\n\\n1) BTC is rising.  The biggest winners of 2018 was the bold investors who bought BTC when it was at around 6K.  These people have seen 70+% in their investments in just a couple of weeks, which is staggering if you think about it.   In the month of February, not many alts have outperformed BTC.  More importantly, I suspect very few of the alt portfolio (because not too many people just hold one alt) have outperformed BTC.  And people are taking notice of this.  This means that at the moment, BTC not only provides stability but also profit, which is a cheating combination.  Moreover, you have a lot of flexibility that when you hold a lot of BTC, you can purchase the alts when they are down a lot, and rinse repeat.  So like it or not, BTC is solid right now. \\n\\n2) ETH is falling.  I hate to say this as I hold a lot of ETH, but if you look at the BTC:ETH ratio the past month or so, ETH is just falling behind like crazy.  I think there has been a flippening of a different kind where back in December 2017, BTC was viewed as being saturated and ETH started gaining grounds.  However, right now, BTC is still viewed as being underpriced and it is still dictating the market movement.  As a ETH holder, I am still relaxed about this, but if the ratio keeps on going down in the next few months, then I might have to re-evaluate my plan.  \\n\\n3) Buy the rumor, sell the news is real.  It doesn't really even matter what the event is.  If a CEO announces that he will post a video of himself taking a dump (pun intended) on youtube on a certain date, there will be a pump and dump leading on to this event.  This is a quick way to make some good profits, but I guess being greedy will kill you if you dump late.  \\n\\n4) Weekend sell-off.  Everyone is worried that there might be a sell-off during the weekend and worried especially with their alt portfolio.  I suspect more people will either convert to BTC or ETH on weekends or some people might even tether up, which means that alts will bleed on weekends (until it doesn't). \\n\\n5) Monday bull rush:  conversely, there is a positive sentiment that alts will rebound big on Monday.  This has also to do with the fact that if the weekend sell off is real, then alts will look very underpriced come Monday.  So I suspect that this point #5 will be coupled to #4 until it doesn't.  \\n\\nSo this is my idea of the market in general and somehow if you combine all this information, then you can probably profit a lot.  That is, until you don't and another re-evaluation of the market would be needed. \",\n",

They are all waiting for a correction. This thing will be at 15k and they will still be waiting for it.\\n\\nAnd everyone, this is why tethering is so dangerous... because the market doesn\\'t just scream up, it slowly creeps up and leaves you questioning if you are doing the right thing? When you should \"FOMO\" in?... \"well, \"FOMO\" is for weak people\" and you are \"strong\", so you get left behind.\\n\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s SO MUCH SIMPLER to just never seal in losses by holding, and take advantage of pullbacks by buying in, in increasing amounts on the pullback. The ONLY time that strategy fails is when the asset goes to zero and stays there. So if you don\\'t believe in crypto, don\\'t do it, tether and short it, and good luck to you. If you believe in crypto longterm, this is the only foolproof play that has zero chance of losing longterm (provided that you never buy massively on a huge bubble pump). \\n\\nTo avoid that, in times that the market rises too high above baseline growth and it looks like we\\'re overbought, just do the opposite of the dip buying. On the dip, you buy in, in increasing amounts, the further you go. On the rise/bubble phase, you lower buys in increasing amounts, then move towards no motion, then move towards small sells, then slightly larger sells, then slightly larger sells, etc. It\\'s impossible to time the market perfectly for sure... but that\\'s why you do it in increments. That \"blends\" your exposure. \\n\\nOnce you sell enough to play with house money, then you can just HODL forever. Maybe take a few grand out here and there. But just hold. I dunno, that\\'s my plan at least, and it\\'s working great. If I can survive the 85% pullback and be about 35% up right now, set up with a strong baseline position, then I think I\\'m looking good. If it pulls back and this actually is a bulltrap, then I just stick with the plan and expand the ground floor, so that when the real bullrun happens, I\\'m even better off.\\n\\nInfact, long long longterm, with this strategy, I think I actually make out BETTER if this thing crashes further, so I can get more cheap buys. Since I\\'m not selling for at least 3, 4, 5, 10 years, the ONLY time that I want the price high is when I sell. I actually do better in the \"between\" phase if we stay lower longer. \\n\\nIt\\'s a good perspective to have... a calming one.',\n",

       "   {'text': 'Guys guys guys... I\\'ve tried to help you out the last couple days. The market has changed. You are all my crypto brothers, even if you have lost your ways to the darkness.\\n\\nThe bear season lasted 3 months, and you are all waiting for a 2 year bear season. The thing is, adoption has happened slowly, in tiny little pieces since the 2014 crash. Stop trying to use past performance to predict the future. So many people know about crypto now, it\\'s not the same at all. There\\'s so much tether and fiat sitting on exchanges just trying to time the dip. \\n\\nThat dip was 3 days ago.\\n\\nStop looking at spikes and calling organic or inorganic growth. We all have a tendency for recency bias. The market dumped 70-85%, how much further would \"make you happy\"? This thing isn\\'t going to zero, no matter how much uncle Heathroy on Facebook tells you it will.\\n\\nRemember why you joined. You joined to change the world, and be part of the ground floor grass roots movement. That movement is now leaving without you.\\n\\nEven with recent runs, we\\'re still at the lowest prices we\\'ll ever see. Don\\'t be that guy who doesn\\'t buy $1200 BTC because he\\'s waiting for it to fall back to $500. It never did, and we\\'ll never see $6k BTC ever again.\\n\\nThe difference? Not the spikes up and down... look at the baseline movement. It\\'s almost completely positive. It\\'s positive DESPITE people shorting it and trying to swing it down. It\\'s positive DESPITE people thinking this is a bulltrap and tethering up. Guys - it\\'s positive despite many people taking \"profits\". They take \"profits\" then have to buy back in higher.  \\n\\nDownwards spikes are getting absorbed in 10-20 mins. Sundays aren\\'t blood red anymore. Daily crypto thread comments are 2k by noon. Subscriptions on the sub appears to be rising too. Positive sentiment comments (even as stupid as YAY MOON) are being upvoted. Guys it\\'s ANNOYING but it\\'s EYE OPENING. SENTIMENT HAS CHANGED. \\n\\nTry it out... go post in this thread that we\\'re in a bulltrap and see what happens. You will get downvoted to oblivion. If you posted that 3 days ago, you would have been top post in the thread.\\n\\nAs much as that is \"people delusioned that we\\'re in a bull market\" according to the most pessimistic out there, what it really is is an indicator of market sentiment. A weak one, but they are ALL AROUND YOU. Open your eyes, and stop trying to time a floor that isn\\'t coming.\\n\\nAs much as buy buy buy into Dec/Jan was a TERRIBLE decision because FOMO kills, this is the START of a LONG bullrun. Continuing to try to do tether tricks and short the market, time a bottom that never comes... that stuff is going to KILL YOU. \\n\\nNow is the time to just get a ticket for the train and start posting Mr Bean train Gifs. The sad times are over. It\\'s time for even the most negative of you out there to wake up, remember why you are here, hop on board, grab a nice coffee, and ENJOY the moonbois, enjoy the hype, enjoy the positivity that will explode throughout this sub in the next 6 months.\\n\\n[If you haven\\'t read my previous post before on just how impactful market sentiment is in determining price, this may be a good time to give it a read. This is why we can be back to ATHs without new money even coming in... imagine when it does...](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7vga1y/i_will_tell_you_exactly_what_is_going_on_here/)\\n\\nCHOO CHOO MATHAFAKAS',\n",

For example, when someone at a real world store asks you \"can I help you?\", they\\'re usually not trying to help you. They\\'re looking to see if you\\'re up to something suspicious. They\\'re also trained to say \"how are you?\", they don\\'t actually care usually how you\\'re doing, it\\'s what they\\'ve been instructed to say. They\\'re trying to not get fired, first and foremost. \\n\\nNothing is real anymore in our society, there is massive isolation and detachment, I saw it earlier at the gym today. People stare at their phones or are listening to music, \"plugged in\" like Mark Zuckerburg was in the 2010 movie \"The Social Network\". \\n\\nIn terms of fraud, those bankers that caused the 2008-early 2009 financial crisis were never punished. In fact, the banks are even bigger now and taking on even more risk via derivatives. We are all STILL nearly powerless against Goldman Sachs, Google, Facebook, and other massive monopolies.  If those companies don\\'t take our money, then our own government will with taxes. If taxes don\\'t take it, then the high cost of living(particularly where I live in the USA) will.\\n\\nCryptocurrency is one of the only ways we can fight back.\\n\\nEvery online site/tv program claims to be trying to service people in some way, but they\\'re really just looking for hits/ratings/likes/attention. They view their \"target demographic\" as their victims, we are the suckers that they\\'ve sold their services to. We have gone from a service economy to an attention economy.\\n\\nPoliticians, sports players, people on tv, these people used to care about making change for the better, but now it\\'s evident that they too are mostly just self-interested and just saying the right words in public to fit whatever political agenda they side with(Trump or anti-Trump), then in private they\\'ll go back to doing whatever it takes to fill their own pockets. These celebrities used to be people to look up to, but not anymore. We don\\'t really have role models or legendary figures, besides Satoshi Nakomoto.\\n\\nBeing invested in crypto is in many ways an attack on all institutions, and I\\'m happy to be part of it now. I wish I had gotten in earlier, I\\'m sure almost all of us here feel similarly.\\n\\n(Sorry that was bit of a rant)\\n\\nI know most cryptos are still down 60+% from their all time highs(Mine are down about 70%), but I still feel passionate about being in cryptocurrency. I would buy more if I could.\\n\\nAnyone else feel similarly about why they\\'re in cryptocurrency as me?',\n",

This means any of the (currently 67) cryptocurrencies supported by shapeshift can be transferred to a particl client and automatically converted to the native PART token for transacting on the Particl network.\\n\\nFurthermore the modular smart contract nature means other widgets and modules can be built to integrate other exchanges (both centralised and decentralised) and services into the Particl network and client e.g changelly integration for USDT:PART integration or widgets that connect direct fiat gateways.\\n\\nParticl also utilises atomic swaps so any other chain which utilizes atomic swaps can directly interact with the Particl network to exchange/swap PART (foregoing exchanges altogether). Current candidates include LTC, DCR and BTC.\\n\\nTo this end its a misconception to think Particle only supports the PART token. It actually supports multiple cryptocurrencies via a mechanic that brings value to the PART token whilst providing a means to buy and sell goods anonymously using those cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n...\\n\\n**There are advantages to this approach:**\\n\\n- For one it means Particl can simplify its user interface by driving all core transactions on the Particl network via the PART token.\\n\\n- It makes the **Particl platform both a fiat/liquidity magnet as it provides non-speculative value to multiple cryptocurrencies** which are sent to it and acts as a liquidity generator since it creates the means for people to buy/sell goods with multiple cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nAs the Particl network grows **this would strengthen the links between cryptocurrency and fiat whilst simultaneously making cryptocurrency more independent of fiat.**\\n\\n- This approach creates economic incentives to hold and promote the token and benefits holders as its value increases in a manner proportional to increasing non-speculative use on the Particl network.\\n\\n- Contrast this with systems like syscoin where the native sys token is not essential to transact. It suffers from diminished speculator and thus network effects to propagate spread, promotion and usage of the native token and even if non-speculative use of the syscoin network increases this does necessarily translate to increased buy demand  on the sys token.\\n\\n- The PART token is used to secure the Particl  network via PoS. Increased non speculative use of the PART token to transact leads to diversification of PART.\\n\\nThose who set their clients to stake to earn a portion of the marketplace/transaction fees + staking rewards thus wind up increasing the node count and diversification which increases the security of the network.\\n\\n- The PART token has a dual nature: A public token for where the added cost/verification time of transacting privately is not necessary and where accountability is a requirement (e.g. selling large volume, low cost, high frequency white-hat goods).\\n\\nA large transaction pool is required to make the private ringCT transactions work. If multiple currencies were allowed to buy/sell goods directly (rather than be first converted to the native PART token), the pool of available transactions for RingCT would be diluted and thus the anonymity ringCT provides would be weakened.\\n\\n...\\n\\nParticl will provide a system where all the economic, network and pragmatic incentives of cryptocurrency are in perfect alignment, something which is not true of many other systems in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.\\n\\nPerhaps the most important thing I haven't stated is that by integrating all the services it does and allowing for modular expansion under one privacy centric platform, **Particl provides convenience and streamlines existing processes for private, anonymous and public commerce independent of traditional fiat.**\\n\\n...\\n\\n**In summary cryptocurrencies that choose to integrate with the Particl platform will instantly find non-speculative uses and revenue. This will drive fiat into those cryptocurrencies, increasing both their liquidity and value as these will now be used to buy and sell goods on the Particl platform via its decentralised marketplace and any other services it offers.**\", 'score': 10, 'date': '10-20-2017'}, {'text': 'What do you guys think is the cause for the drop of Chainlink?

The client nodes have the capacity for sending encrypted messages between each other allowing for truly private communications between individuals on the Particl network.\\n\\n- Settlement security by providing a trustless third party free escrow service (the mutually assured destruction escrow) whereby both seller and buyer deposit a bond that can only be released when both sides agree goods/services have been delivered as specified.\\n\\n...\\n\\nWhilst Monero and other private currencies offer anonymous transaction security with the benefits of decentralisation, they do not provide the other forms of decentralised security I've just listed *which Particl and currently Particl alone proposes to*.\\n\\nYes decentralised marketplaces could accept monero *currency* but they would have to provide decentralised, trustless privacy centric escrow, communications and private listings to provide the same level of service and flexibility of selling/buying options that the Particl *platform* provides.\\n\\nThis is because in addition to what I've described Particl also enables anonymous or public settlement of public listings.\\n\\n...\\n\\nThe biggest single threat to ecommerce is censorship either by the platform provider or by take down of the platform provider. We have seen multiple platforms that use XMR disappear and we have many documented instances of legitimate, legal commerce being censored by the platform provider for reasons that are often questionable at best. \\n\\n**The Particl network provides a resilient platform to protect against censorship.**\\n\\n...\\n\\nPerhaps the most important thing I haven't stated is that by integrating all the services it does and allowing for modular expansion under one privacy centric platform, **Particl provides convenience and streamlines existing processes for private, anonymous and public commerce independent of traditional fiat.**\\n\\n...\\n\\n**NB: I am bullish on XMR.** It had an incredible network effect going which has not been realised yet. I'd rather the XMR team understood the ethos behind Particl and looked for opportunities to collaborate in this instance as an XMR:PART integration would represent the ultimate in private tx for me.\\n\\n**Addendum:** Before you vote on this, carefully consider the merit of what I'm saying and imagine what it would be like if such a system were to hypothetically exist regardless of who developed it.

Simply put commerce without borders and a massive boon for sensitive transactions.\\n\\nI am ignoring all price activity for now. The project will not use it's funds to needlessly hype and will likely deliver the marketplace minimum viable product in Q1 2018 to justify it and silence all critics. \\n\\nThis is because the team (which is now greatly expanded and actually funded) have been heavily criticised for not delivering in the past (as the much smaller, unfunded SDC prior to setting up their foundation) in spite of the history showing clear development (actually rapid for a project of this nature) and currently meeting all milestones given.\\n\\nFrom a speculative point of view there are numerous reasons to preferentially invest in Particl:\\n\\n- Holding tokens confers true stakeholder ownership of the network, \\n\\n- Receipt of transaction fees proportional to stake and number of transactions on the network. \\n\\n- Receipt of interest but with decreasing annual inflation rate (5% PA year one to flat 2% year 4 onwards) to facilitate early adoption. \\n\\n- Limited token supply with significant lockup due to PoS. When marketplace is launched if used, the buy demand on PART will be massive relative to circulating supply even for small scale use of the marketplace which should drive up the price of PART massively.\\n\\nIf Particl is successful then I believe it will be a literal juggernaut in the making as far as use cases, speculative returns and technology advances in crypto go.\\n\\n...\\n\\nThere are those that doubt such a technology will be delivered, I am **not** advising you to buy but I am advising you to watch.

The second was after this attention was brought to the coin and it started to slowly rise, Ledger support was added, this was when the coin really started to get some legs and take off.

Longer term however I view it very differently to other assets due to it's liquidity characteristics which resemble DASH but with actual utility to self perpetuate it. \\n\\nThis is because:\\n\\n- People decide to use the Particl marketplace.\\n- People sent their crypto to the Particl client.\\n- This converts to PART: Buy pressure on PART.\\n- People buy PART in the Particl client to transact.\\n- People use PART escrow: PARTs get locked into escrow contract.\\n- Circulating supply of PART gets further restricted.\\n- Successful buying/selling of goods = repeat custom exclusively in PART token.\\n- Repeat custom = regular repeat buy pressure on PART per individual.\\n- Repeat custom = word of mouth = more new customers on Particl marketplace. This perpetuates first step.\\n- Buy pressure increases. More escrows. Further liquidity lockup.\\n\\n...\\n\\n- More dApps (beyond market place) release as PART hype & awareness increases = more buy pressure on PART.\\n\\n- Staking locks away PART also restricting circulating supply.\\n\\n- As value of PART increases incentive to stake increases (as stakers earn tx fees). As PART value increases and tx frequency increases, stakers earn more rewards perpetuating further staking.\\n\\n- More PART gets locked in staking. Lower circulating supply.\\n\\n- Rapidly escalating PART price.\\n\\nSo provided it is released as described and people use it as a marketplace non-speculatively, with time it's price should rise exponentially independent of traditional exchange dependent model.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI hope this makes it super clear why I rank Particl on par with Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of price growth potential.\\n\\n...\\n\\n**Full disclosure:** I am long Ethereum (ETH), Particl (PART), OmiseGo (OMG), Wetrust (TRST), Iconomi (ICN) and Augur (REP).\\n\\nAll trading decisions are your own please do your due dilligence and independent multi-sourced research.\", 'score': 6, 'date': '10-31-2017'}, {'text': 'I see a lot of talk of Monaco officially partnering with VISA talk today (not sure if it is specifically in Singapore or world wide), but cannot find any legitimate sources confirming this... anyone have confirmation??', 'score': 5, 'date': '10-31-2017'}, {'text': '[deleted]', 'score': 5, 'date': '10-31-2017'}, {'text': \"hey congrats to anyone who bought groestle coin under .50centsusd acouple days ago, feels good. it's been a good week for vtc and grs holders \", 'score': 6, 'date': '10-31-2017'}]}\n",

      "{'post_date': datetime.date(2018, 1, 5), 'comments': [{'text': 'To address a lot of the worrying things I\\'m seeing in this thread from complete investing newbies...\\n\\n1. If you aren\\'t prepared for the price to go down, 40, 60, or even 100% then you should not be invested in cryptocurrencies, let alone risky small cap investments. If you want to play in this space you have to be absolutely sure that when you see this happen, you don\\'t panic, evaluate the situation as a whole, and remember what the goals of your trade were in the first place. This is partially why it\\'s so important to invest in stuff you believe in and understand...when the weather gets bad you want to make sure you can withstand the storm because you believe it will end eventually. And if you fancy yourself a day trader, then before you get into a trade make sure you have set goals and stop losses, otherwise your floundering with no plan.\\n\\n2. If you\\'re putting money in thinking it\\'s just always going to go up. Days like this are normal in all markets, and while it sucks to feel like you\\'re losing money the ultimate lesson an investor can learn is patience. Because it seems to me many of the people who post here have never invested in other markets and expect everything to go up 100% a week. Crypto moves faster than any market, and what seems like a disaster today could be completely forgotten in three. \\n\\n3. STOP TRADING TO FOMO. Everyone keeps asking if they should trade all their down alts to go for BTC...WHY? You\\'re trading in your assets at a discount to buy an asset at a premium. Just because you feel like you\\'re missing out, don\\'t chase it. Read this thread or any other to see countless stories of people selling to chase a new coin, only to have the coin they just sold rise 50% over the next day. In crypto, if you believe in the project, hold tight. The majority of active traders lose money.\\n\\n4. There are two types of people you can be here. For example, in a month when XLM crosses a dollar there is going to be one person saying \"thank god I bought that dip at 62\" and one person saying \"well got in at 1.01, hope this works out\". Which do you want to be?\\n\\n5. It\\'s a lot easier to hold something if you believe in it. So if you\\'re just here buying coins that you don\\'t understand with no real value, it\\'s going to be a lot harder when you see it go down to sit tight. \\n\\n6. You should always have some ETH and BTC in your portfolio. The fact that many of you view them as \"boring\" is extremely worrisome. A stock portfolio returning 30% in a year would be absolutely killing it, but you think that if bitcoin only goes up 100% it\\'s a total waste. If you want to be in the crypto market, make sure you hedge a bit. As BTC goes up, Alts tend to go down.\\n\\n7. Be careful of the excessive shilling that occurs here and on other forums. Many of the coins are shilled but for good reasons, but many more are people just trying to suckers other into buying because they are nervous they made a bad decision. With that being said, some of the coins you\\'ve been reading here a lot DO have a bright future, and can be considered \"Safer\" picks in such a crazy market, i.e. REQ VEN XMR NEO XLM. Do your research on this coins. Research the team, research the product, research the potential use cases and potential amount of users.

You would think there is some testing before publishing on master branch.. Unless the developers are happy with their users seeing Opalcoin in their Verge software. What makes it even worse is that OpalCoin 4clause BSD license requires any party that uses their code to give them credit in advertisement material, something that never happened from the Verge team.

It does get frustrating to see the price dropping, then jump a bit, stagnate, then drop again. \\n\\nBut, this sounds cliché, but if you are a believer in crypto, the technology behind it, and are throwing your support behind solid projects instead of shitcoins, then this ride will be easier.\\n\\n>In contrast, there's no significant community of people who conduct commerce exclusively (or even primarily) in Bitcoins. And you can't eat, live in, or make jewelry out of Bitcoins. And this means there's no logical stopping point to Bitcoin's price decline. So far Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buying Bitcoins as the price falls, convinced that the price will go back up eventually. But as the hoped-for rally has failed to materialize, more have gotten discouraged or bored and cash out, pushing the price down further. This process has been going on for a couple of months, and now it appears to be accelerating. I suspect it's terminal.\\n\\nThat is a quote from August of 2011, during a period where the price of Bitcoin dropped from an ATH of $32 to its then-price of $6.50. People have been writing off Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) and predicting it's demise since it was created. And it's still here, still flexing its muscles and it's here to stay.

Honestly, how often do we have to see this same pattern until you people finally realize that this is just the normal life cycle of every promising coin? A few people find it, invest, and start the shilling. Once enough people are convinced, the price starts to go up. Maybe there\\'s some good news or some positive tweet, and suddenly daytraders see their chance to jump on the train, and the price shoots up like crazy within days. Now all those kids go crazy and think they have found the new ETH and we see lambo memes and out-of-this-world price predictions for EOY with 100x or even more everywhere. \\n\\nHowever, once the market is saturated the day traders take their profits and move on to the next coin. The price dumps down to 70% of ATH. Now the FUD starts. Those who bought at ATH panic sell. Those who had missed the train in the first place enjoy to gloat over the others misfortunes and post their \"I told you so\" FUD everywhere. Consequently, the price goes down to 50% of ATH. Suddenly those who thought they have found the new ETH realize that they were wrong all along. They see the price dumping, they see all this FUD, and then sell their holdings to jump on the next coin which they think is the new ETH. And the funny thing is, all along NOTHING has changed about the coin at all. The idea, the code, the team, the collaborations and partners are all still exactly the same. Only the market price went up by 500% and then crashed down again almost to where it took off. Then, it typically takes some time to recover, but all the good coins come back eventually. And once they do, everybody that sold before jumps on the train again.\\n\\nSure, this pattern is so obvious you could just go ahead and daytrade. Get it on time and sell on time. If you\\'re good at this, you can make good money from this. Or you just ignore all the shilling and FUD, the 200% gains and the 80% losses, completely, you just do your research, invest, and hold. Just accept the fact that the current price is irrelevant as long as you don\\'t want to sell. Nobody wants to buy XRB right now and therefore the price goes down.

If you want to sell, ask yourself why you didn\\'t want to sell it a few weeks ago when the price was much higher than it is now. Why would you want to sell VEN for $7 when you didn\\'t want to sell it for $10? Why would you want to sell XRB for $12 if you didn\\'t want to sell it for $30 just a few weeks ago? \\n\\nSo decide, what do you want to do? If you want to hold long term, then choose projects you believe in and don\\'t panic once day traders sell and move on to the next pump. Or do you want to daytrade, always chasing the next pump? That\\'s fine as well, but then sell at highs and don\\'t wait until the shill is over and your coin gets dumped. Every coin, no matter how good it is, will get dumped after a big pump.

What funding do they have? Do they even have a working platform? If not, What\\'s the application they are working for and what are their benchmarks? Is the coin actually used to power the tech or is it just a \"coin\" that has no real function?\\n\\nThe reason why people spend hours really digging into these coins and the projects behind them is because it\\'s extremely important to understand the REAL risk.\\n\\nIf I can create a coin in 20 minutes, put up a website in an hour, and have a ico promising pipe dreams, ready to launch in a week, in a world with no rules or regulations...\\n\\nJust want to make sure everyone is safe.

I won\\'t lie when I say it\\'s a lot different than what most people on this subreddit have in their portfolios:\\n\\n- **Monero**: 40%\\n\\n- **Coss**: 20%\\n\\n- **Siacoin**: 10%\\n\\n- **Aeon**: 9%\\n\\n- **Ethereum**: 8%\\n\\n- **Neo**: 5%\\n\\n- **Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash**: 5%\\n\\n- **Litecoin**: 3%\\n\\nMy two satoshis on why I bought what I bought:\\n\\n- As you can tell from my flair, Monero makes up the bulk of my portfolio. I bought it back in 2016 after it first pumped to several dollars from the now defunct AlphaBay accepting it for payment. It is by far the one coin I have the most faith and confidence in. Monero is what Bitcoin should have been from the very start. Its privacy, dynamic blocksize, egalitarian hashing algorithm, and tail emission all combined together address a lot of Bitcoin\\'s big weaknesses.\\n\\n- COSS is by far my riskiest asset. I have already made a huge amount of money from it since I scooped up a truckload of it when it was worth pennies. The fee splits provided by COSS are unbelievably generous, and from them you can almost build a sort of psuedo-index fund from fee splits. If COSS can get its exchange up and running, with a good engine to handle increased volume, and the fiat ramps working, this will be an epic moonshot and the passive income will set me up for life. Currently I\\'m using the fee splits to simply stack up on more COSS. I make enough from fee splits as it is to distribute COSS + convert to/distribute the ETH which is then reinvested into buying more COSS. Again though, COSS is a huge risk. Their last UI rollout did not go well, and they had a fatal bug that forced people into using market orders instead of limit orders for a short time. There is a definite non-zero chance they could mess up the introduction of fiat and/or not be able to handle an increased load of traffic, and that would not bode well at all. I have confidence in them being able to succeed though!\\n\\n- Siacoin is a personal favorite of mine. Decentralized cloud storage is going to become a big thing in the near future, and I really like the Sia team\\'s ambitious roadmap and their knowledge of software / crypto development.\\n\\n- Aeon is another small MCap/big gamble. For those not familiar with it, Aeon is like Monero\\'s little brother. It\\'s designed to be a lightweight version of Monero that can run on and be mined on mobile phones. Think of it like being Monero\\'s version of Litecoin. Currently, Aeon is coming right off the middle of a code rebase, which is really big news for such a small coin.\\n\\n- I would have more ETH in my portfolio... unfortunately for me, I was really turned off by ETH from the DAO hack and way it was handled. I didn\\'t buy as much ETH as I could have. Given how much ETH has gone up from 2017, that one hurt.\\n\\n- NEO is another good blue chip. I like being able to generate GAS from just having it sit in my wallet. If you want a good \"HODL\", NEO is awesome in that regard.\\n\\n- All portfolios should have at least some BTC. I don\\'t care how much you have; just make sure it isn\\'t very close to or at 0%. It is a grave mistake to be 100% all in alts. I have a lot of issues with BTC\\'s fees, slow tx times, and lack of privacy/fungibility. However, I cannot deny its enormous hashrate and first-mover advantage. You do not want to see BTC suffer. If BTC goes down, it takes everything else down with it.\\n\\n- Litecoin rounds out my portfolio as another blue chip. I expect LTC to thrive in the future even though it will be challenged by Nano, and its hashrate has exploded to over 140 TH/s. That is a very good sign for its price.\\n\\nSo there you have it. Most of this was done from simple DYOR, along with buying a lot of it back in 2016/early 2017 when prices were a lot lower than where they are now. I may start to get my feet wet with some other coins that are constantly repeated over and over again (you guys know what they are), but I\\'m wary of the fact that many people probably bought those coins at their ATHs and are just desperate for another pump so they can unload their bags and try to chase another coin.\\n\\nFor those of you looking for legitimate advice on how/what to invest in:\\n\\n- Do an intense amount of research on a coin before you buy. Do not buy something on just Reddit/Twitter/4chan hype. Read the whitepaper, and then read it again. Look at the Github activity and what is being done on development for the project. Be cautious about investing in anything that has no working product.\\n\\n- Do not buy at an ATH. Do not succumb to FOMO. If you absolutely must buy something *right now*, expect to be in the red for the short term.\\n\\n- Dollar-cost-average your purchases. \\n\\n- Don\\'t be afraid to take profits.\\n\\n- Do not try to time the market. Do not try to daytrade. And for god\\'s sake, don\\'t even think about margin trading. You\\'ll probably have better luck playing Russian Roulette than seeing your 50 BTC 40x long position get liquidated. There are very painful stories on large trading subreddits where people holding millions of dollars in crypto lost it all because they got greedy. If you MUST actively trade, set aside funds that you know you won\\'t touch. IMO I like to be more conservative in this environment. I will sell and profit take, but for the most I just buy and hold. You\\'ll sleep better at night if you do.\\n\\n- It\\'s kinda ok to look at Blockfolio or CMC all the time, even if it ultimately isn\\'t good for you. I admit, I look at it a lot. The problem comes when you panic at seeing your portfolio take a big hit like when we had the recent crash. If you\\'re sweating bullets in a bear market, you either A) invested more than you could afford to lose or B) bought coins you don\\'t really believe in.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping in the near future to be a bit more active in these daily threads because I know there are people out there who want to see more quality posts in these dailies.

Now this is not to say that they will be winning moves a month from now or even couple of weeks from now, and again I state that these are my opinions. \\n\\n1) BTC is rising.  The biggest winners of 2018 was the bold investors who bought BTC when it was at around 6K.  These people have seen 70+% in their investments in just a couple of weeks, which is staggering if you think about it.   In the month of February, not many alts have outperformed BTC.  More importantly, I suspect very few of the alt portfolio (because not too many people just hold one alt) have outperformed BTC.  And people are taking notice of this.  This means that at the moment, BTC not only provides stability but also profit, which is a cheating combination.  Moreover, you have a lot of flexibility that when you hold a lot of BTC, you can purchase the alts when they are down a lot, and rinse repeat.  So like it or not, BTC is solid right now. \\n\\n2) ETH is falling.  I hate to say this as I hold a lot of ETH, but if you look at the BTC:ETH ratio the past month or so, ETH is just falling behind like crazy.  I think there has been a flippening of a different kind where back in December 2017, BTC was viewed as being saturated and ETH started gaining grounds.  However, right now, BTC is still viewed as being underpriced and it is still dictating the market movement.  As a ETH holder, I am still relaxed about this, but if the ratio keeps on going down in the next few months, then I might have to re-evaluate my plan.  \\n\\n3) Buy the rumor, sell the news is real.  It doesn't really even matter what the event is.  If a CEO announces that he will post a video of himself taking a dump (pun intended) on youtube on a certain date, there will be a pump and dump leading on to this event.  This is a quick way to make some good profits, but I guess being greedy will kill you if you dump late.  \\n\\n4) Weekend sell-off.  Everyone is worried that there might be a sell-off during the weekend and worried especially with their alt portfolio.  I suspect more people will either convert to BTC or ETH on weekends or some people might even tether up, which means that alts will bleed on weekends (until it doesn't). \\n\\n5) Monday bull rush:  conversely, there is a positive sentiment that alts will rebound big on Monday.  This has also to do with the fact that if the weekend sell off is real, then alts will look very underpriced come Monday.  So I suspect that this point #5 will be coupled to #4 until it doesn't.  \\n\\nSo this is my idea of the market in general and somehow if you combine all this information, then you can probably profit a lot.  That is, until you don't and another re-evaluation of the market would be needed. \", 'score': 38, 'date': '02-18-2018'}, {'text': 'First time checking in a few weeks \\n\\n\\n*sees I’m still down 30%*\\n\\n\\nSee you in March!', 'score': 34, 'date': '02-18-2018'}, {'text': \"Ahh red, my old friend, how are you?

When you should \"FOMO\" in?... \"well, \"FOMO\" is for weak people\" and you are \"strong\", so you get left behind.\\n\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s SO MUCH SIMPLER to just never seal in losses by holding, and take advantage of pullbacks by buying in, in increasing amounts on the pullback. The ONLY time that strategy fails is when the asset goes to zero and stays there. So if you don\\'t believe in crypto, don\\'t do it, tether and short it, and good luck to you. If you believe in crypto longterm, this is the only foolproof play that has zero chance of losing longterm (provided that you never buy massively on a huge bubble pump). \\n\\nTo avoid that, in times that the market rises too high above baseline growth and it looks like we\\'re overbought, just do the opposite of the dip buying. On the dip, you buy in, in increasing amounts, the further you go. On the rise/bubble phase, you lower buys in increasing amounts, then move towards no motion, then move towards small sells, then slightly larger sells, then slightly larger sells, etc. It\\'s impossible to time the market perfectly for sure... but that\\'s why you do it in increments. That \"blends\" your exposure. \\n\\nOnce you sell enough to play with house money, then you can just HODL forever. Maybe take a few grand out here and there. But just hold. I dunno, that\\'s my plan at least, and it\\'s working great. If I can survive the 85% pullback and be about 35% up right now, set up with a strong baseline position, then I think I\\'m looking good. If it pulls back and this actually is a bulltrap, then I just stick with the plan and expand the ground floor, so that when the real bullrun happens, I\\'m even better off.\\n\\nInfact, long long longterm, with this strategy, I think I actually make out BETTER if this thing crashes further, so I can get more cheap buys. Since I\\'m not selling for at least 3, 4, 5, 10 years, the ONLY time that I want the price high is when I sell.

I\\'ve tried to help you out the last couple days. The market has changed. You are all my crypto brothers, even if you have lost your ways to the darkness.\\n\\nThe bear season lasted 3 months, and you are all waiting for a 2 year bear season. The thing is, adoption has happened slowly, in tiny little pieces since the 2014 crash. Stop trying to use past performance to predict the future. So many people know about crypto now, it\\'s not the same at all. There\\'s so much tether and fiat sitting on exchanges just trying to time the dip. \\n\\nThat dip was 3 days ago.\\n\\nStop looking at spikes and calling organic or inorganic growth. We all have a tendency for recency bias. The market dumped 70-85%, how much further would \"make you happy\"? This thing isn\\'t going to zero, no matter how much uncle Heathroy on Facebook tells you it will.\\n\\nRemember why you joined. You joined to change the world, and be part of the ground floor grass roots movement. That movement is now leaving without you.\\n\\nEven with recent runs, we\\'re still at the lowest prices we\\'ll ever see. Don\\'t be that guy who doesn\\'t buy $1200 BTC because he\\'s waiting for it to fall back to $500. It never did, and we\\'ll never see $6k BTC ever again.\\n\\nThe difference? Not the spikes up and down... look at the baseline movement. It\\'s almost completely positive. It\\'s positive DESPITE people shorting it and trying to swing it down. It\\'s positive DESPITE people thinking this is a bulltrap and tethering up. Guys - it\\'s positive despite many people taking \"profits\". They take \"profits\" then have to buy back in higher.  \\n\\nDownwards spikes are getting absorbed in 10-20 mins. Sundays aren\\'t blood red anymore. Daily crypto thread comments are 2k by noon. Subscriptions on the sub appears to be rising too. Positive sentiment comments (even as stupid as YAY MOON) are being upvoted. Guys it\\'s ANNOYING but it\\'s EYE OPENING. SENTIMENT HAS CHANGED. \\n\\nTry it out... go post in this thread that we\\'re in a bulltrap and see what happens. You will get downvoted to oblivion. If you posted that 3 days ago, you would have been top post in the thread.\\n\\nAs much as that is \"people delusioned that we\\'re in a bull market\" according to the most pessimistic out there, what it really is is an indicator of market sentiment. A weak one, but they are ALL AROUND YOU. Open your eyes, and stop trying to time a floor that isn\\'t coming.\\n\\nAs much as buy buy buy into Dec/Jan was a TERRIBLE decision because FOMO kills, this is the START of a LONG bullrun. Continuing to try to do tether tricks and short the market, time a bottom that never comes... that stuff is going to KILL YOU. \\n\\nNow is the time to just get a ticket for the train and start posting Mr Bean train Gifs. The sad times are over. It\\'s time for even the most negative of you out there to wake up, remember why you are here, hop on board, grab a nice coffee, and ENJOY the moonbois, enjoy the hype, enjoy the positivity that will explode throughout this sub in the next 6 months.\\n\\n[If you haven\\'t read my previous post before on just how impactful market sentiment is in determining price, this may be a good time to give it a read.

They\\'re also trained to say \"how are you?\", they don\\'t actually care usually how you\\'re doing, it\\'s what they\\'ve been instructed to say. They\\'re trying to not get fired, first and foremost. \\n\\nNothing is real anymore in our society, there is massive isolation and detachment, I saw it earlier at the gym today. People stare at their phones or are listening to music, \"plugged in\" like Mark Zuckerburg was in the 2010 movie \"The Social Network\". \\n\\nIn terms of fraud, those bankers that caused the 2008-early 2009 financial crisis were never punished.

If taxes don\\'t take it, then the high cost of living(particularly where I live in the USA) will.\\n\\nCryptocurrency is one of the only ways we can fight back.\\n\\nEvery online site/tv program claims to be trying to service people in some way, but they\\'re really just looking for hits/ratings/likes/attention. They view their \"target demographic\" as their victims, we are the suckers that they\\'ve sold their services to. We have gone from a service economy to an attention economy.\\n\\nPoliticians, sports players, people on tv, these people used to care about making change for the better, but now it\\'s evident that they too are mostly just self-interested and just saying the right words in public to fit whatever political agenda they side with(Trump or anti-Trump), then in private they\\'ll go back to doing whatever it takes to fill their own pockets. These celebrities used to be people to look up to, but not anymore. We don\\'t really have role models or legendary figures, besides Satoshi Nakomoto.\\n\\nBeing invested in crypto is in many ways an attack on all institutions, and I\\'m happy to be part of it now.
